My name is Stuart Smith, and I work as the Digital Skills Developer at the University of Greenwich, a unique role focusing on student engagement with digital technologies. This role builds on earlier work I’ve done in learning technology in both commercial and university settings.

Technology isn’t something I add into my work—it’s woven into it. My pedagogical stance is rooted in constructivist and humanist traditions (Vygotsky, 1978; Freire, 1970; Rogers, 1969), which emphasise learner agency, reflection, and the social context of knowledge building.

With the rise of generative AI, tools like Copilot have become central to my work. They are transformative in how we think, create, and support learners.

As part of the PGCert module, we were encouraged to use Microsoft Sway to present our portfolios. While Sway is a powerful tool integrated within Microsoft 365—an advantage for institutions already using that ecosystem—if the portfolio author leaves the Sway-hosting institution, the portfolio is lost unless exported as a static PDF or Word file. This is very limiting for a portfolio. In contrast, I chose to build my portfolio using Jekyll and Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight, structured format that promotes portability, accessibility, and web-standards compliance. Combining Markdown with HTML, CSS, and other web technologies creates a powerful, fast-loading, low-resource tool for sharing information.

A more technical and independent approach to portfolio creation aligns with my belief that educators should understand the underlying technologies they use. WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) tools like Sway or Squarespace offer ease but can mask key accessibility and interoperability considerations.

In the early sci-fi novel *The Machine Stops*, E.M. Forster warned of a society that placed blind trust in a system no one truly understood. <q>“You talk as if a god had made the Machine… I believe that you pray to it when you are unhappy. Men made it, do not forget that.”</q> (Forster, 1928). We must be careful not to confuse convenience with resilience. By engaging directly with web code, I’m better positioned to problem-solve, advocate for inclusive design, and promote technical curiosity. These are essential traits in a digitally fluent educator.

## Reflective Area 1 Operational Issues

A core part of my practice involves teaching students how to utilise tools like Copilot and other digital technologies to support their everyday learning. Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) is rapidly becoming a widely adopted tool in everyday life. It is in line with PSF K2 to help students learn how to use this tool appropriately to support their studies and as a subject in its own right. This reflects my own practice. For example, when I was running an Excel tutorial and discovered that key learning materials had been deprecated, I used Copilot in real time to generate a new learning activity based on prompts that students helped craft. This turned what could’ve been a failure into a moment of digital empowerment. Students saw that a lack of knowledge wasn’t a dead end—it was an opportunity for collaboration, experimentation, and co-creation.

Copilot excels in many areas, particularly as a personal tutor or coach. Its ability to understand natural language, propose ideas, and reframe problems makes it very useful for students with lower confidence or those from non-traditional learning backgrounds. This reflects PSF V2, helping ensure equity of access to opportunity. But it’s not without constraints. Enterprise-level censorship, hallucinations, and limited philosophical depth can frustrate more advanced users. In particular, Microsoft has implemented filters in Copilot that block certain terms—such as those associated with violence, politics, or elections—which can hinder academic inquiry in higher education (Field, 2024). In terms of ethical use, Copilot’s cheerful tone sometimes masks a lack of clarity about its boundaries, and it can become evasive when questioned about deeper topics.

Additionally, I am implementing SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) and LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) integrations to ensure improved access to LinkedIn Learning across Moodle. This technical foundation is helping embed digital learning more meaningfully within the student experience. While a technical activity, the integration into Moodle is supportive of PSF A2: students and tutors already use Moodle, so it is appropriate to use this familiar environment as a bridge to new learning. Students and tutors will have fewer steps to access the learning materials of LinkedIn Learning by having it embedded in Moodle. As Moodle is the preferred learning environment at the institution, it makes sense to remove barriers to resource uptake by simplifying access. SCIM will mean that students have smoother access to LinkedIn Learning materials and, additionally, tutors will be able to track learning in the Moodle system alongside their own teaching materials.

In the development of the Digital Backpack, I have been working cross-institutionally to address a critical gap in student skills assessment (Jisc, 2019). The project reflects my ability to manage complex TEL initiatives aligned with both pedagogical goals and institutional strategy. Through iterative consultation, I ensured the design was both pedagogically robust and operationally feasible. The assessment is an important starting point in making sure that learners receive the right support and guidance (PSF A4) to develop their digital skills. Confidence building is a key part of my work in teaching digital skills. The Digital Backpack is an extension of the confidence measures that I use in my workshops. One of my teaching observers remarked, “Starting the session with an individual confidence-level test is a great way to encourage people to think about their prior knowledge.” The Digital Backpack will encourage further, more detailed reflection to help students recognise the areas they need to address.

I have learned that it is very difficult to combat subjectivity in the development of assessment tools such as these. We all have biases, but I feel that by engaging with students and colleagues in the development process, I have the best chance of reducing their impact. The Digital Backpack is in its first iteration, and I am keen to emphasise that there is much to be learned; gathering and acting on the lessons will ensure that the tool becomes more finished and more useful.

Increasingly, I champion Markdown as a core TEL production tool. Markdown is one of the oldest and most robust text formats available and has particular value in education because of its accessibility, structure, and long-term archival viability. As Oelen and Auer (2019) note, <q>“it is possible to create presentation slides without the need for visual interaction, making it suitable for non-sighted users,”</q> highlighting Markdown’s compatibility with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation. Unfortunately, Microsoft’s broader ecosystem isn’t Markdown-friendly. Word and Teams, for instance, don’t offer clean Markdown workflows, which can present real limitations when working with screen readers or preparing structured content for future reuse.

## Reflective Area 2 – Learning, Teaching and Assessment

All of my teaching currently takes place online, primarily through Microsoft Teams. I’ve adapted my sessions to be fully interactive, even when students don’t turn on their cameras. This approach reflects PSF A1 and A2; it’s important to acknowledge how students prefer to engage online and to design and plan learning accordingly. Teaching needs to adapt to the social reality that the online space is different from the physical. Tools like Mentimeter and Microsoft Forms allow me to create moments of live feedback and insight. These tools directly support a constructivist approach by enabling students to co-construct understanding through peer insight, shared questions, and formative, interactive contributions in real time. These tools help students who might otherwise be silent in a traditional classroom feel seen and heard. Mentimeter’s anonymity, in particular, is powerful; it gives students permission to admit they don’t know something or to experiment with an idea they aren’t confident about yet. Tools allowing anonymity are incredibly helpful when meeting PSF A3 by allowing the tutor to give direct feedback without identifying the student.

Copilot has become foundational to my teaching strategy. In an Excel session, for example, students were able to use Copilot to create custom tutorials based on their own goals and questions. This not only increased relevance but showed students how to take ownership of their learning journey. This supports PSF K2 and gives learners agency in their own learning journey. Separately, when demonstrating Microsoft Word’s Editor feature—which is distinct from Copilot and focuses on spelling, grammar, and style—many students were surprised to learn they already had access to such targeted support. These features are particularly empowering for those with lower academic English levels or dyslexia, providing real-time feedback that enhances writing quality without requiring generative input. This aligns with recent research showing that AI-enhanced tools, such as those that restructure and annotate text, can significantly improve the learning experience for students with dyslexia by reducing cognitive load and supporting comprehension (Zhao et al., 2025). Since Gen AI can be controlled directly by the learner, we can meet PSF V1 and retain respect for each individual in a diverse environment as learners can decide how they will use AI to support their learning.

I’ve also noticed that TEL can be a double-edged sword. The lack of student cameras can make teaching online feel isolating, and bandwidth limitations or noisy environments mean many students attend from less-than-ideal locations. However, by incorporating chat-based interaction, flexible feedback loops, and design that anticipates these limitations, we still create valuable experiences. I am committed to promoting engagement with learning (PSF V2), but to remain engaged myself—and to understand where students are at—I have had to develop different approaches and uses of the technology.

Inclusion remains a priority. Many of our students are multilingual, and some have experienced educational trauma. When one mature student, previously bullied in her workplace over digital skills, realised she could use Copilot to reframe complex information in her own words, she cried with relief. That moment reminded me of the profound emotional and psychological role TEL can play in helping people reclaim their agency.

## Reflective Area 3 – Wider Context

\<img

/>

Accessibility and data ethics are foundational concerns in my work. My MSc dissertation, *Can a Virtual Learning Environment Interface Meet the Needs of Dyslexics and Non-Dyslexics?* (Smith, 2001), focused on interface design for learners with specific needs, particularly around reducing a prescriptive approach to lesson design, often shaped by rigid or inflexible syllabus-driven models. Since then, I’ve contributed to Jisc publications on accessibility (Smith, 2002). These principles continue to shape my TEL work today, especially in designing tools and resources that account for diverse learning styles and neurodiversity. I continue to attain new Continuing Professional Development (CPD) certificates and use tools like LinkedIn Learning to enhance and update my practice (PSF A5). Additionally, I collaborate with peers through formal and informal networks to mutually enhance our practices (PSF V5).

Ethically, we face difficult questions around AI. Scholars such as Selwyn (2019) and Luckin (2018) argue that while AI presents opportunities for personalised learning, it also raises issues around equity, bias, and educational values. Should students be allowed to write essays in their first language and use AI to translate into English? Current policy says no, but we admit students knowing they don’t yet have academic English proficiency. If we’re not willing to allow AI-assisted translation, are we also willing to ban private tutoring, which creates far greater inequality? These are the kinds of dilemmas we need to address honestly and empathetically. Without professional discussion and challenges to the status quo, we risk losing the chance to bring enhancement to a broader, diverse range of learners—even though AI technology has great potential to bring equity and broad opportunities to education in line with PSF V2.

I teach students that managing information isn’t about hoarding—it’s about stewardship: knowing where your data is, why it’s there, and who can access it. This sits alongside my wider work in promoting open standards and accessible formats. Both data practices and content choices reflect a deeper commitment to transparency, control, and learner autonomy.

Many students at Greenwich face significant digital inequality. My work on the Digital Backpack was designed to acknowledge and respond to this reality, offering students a scaffolded, non-judgemental path toward digital competence using familiar platforms like Microsoft 365 and LinkedIn Learning.

This is an undeniably exciting time for artificial intelligence in education. There are unprecedented opportunities for personalisation, automation, and insight. However, it differs significantly from earlier digital transformations such as the rise of the web, which was largely built on open-source principles and decentralised infrastructure. Generative AI, by contrast, demands vast computing power and costly infrastructure. While open-source models are emerging and can be adapted or fine-tuned locally, the dominant players—Copilot, ChatGPT, and Gemini—remain proprietary, closed-source systems that are expensive to access and tightly controlled by large corporations. This raises important questions for education. If institutions embed AI tools deeply into their teaching and operational practices, what happens when those tools are owned and governed by profit-driven companies? As Bill Gates observed, the AI provider that builds the most effective personal agent may come to dominate how users access and interact with digital services. For education, this prompts careful consideration: should we rely so heavily on one supplier? Can we maintain flexibility, transparency, and pedagogical integrity in an AI landscape that is increasingly centralised?

> “There will be one company that creates a personal agent that will understand all your activities... That's a big thing because you'll never go to a search site again. You'll never go to a productivity tool again. You'll never go to Amazon again. Everything will be mediated through your agent... Whoever wins that will take the current dispersed, high profit areas, and move them into a single area.”
> — Gates (2023)

## Reflective Area 4 – Specialist Interest (PSF A5, K1, K4, K5, V3)

My core area of specialist interest is the intersection of generative AI, immersive environments, and personalised learning. I'm especially drawn to open-source AI models that can run locally and be combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks. With these tools, students can interrogate large sets of course data, reading lists, and materials using natural language—in their own voice and at their own pace. I believe it is in the spirit of PSF A5 to enhance my practice by developing these skills and pushing the boundaries of technology in learning.

I see huge potential for building learning companions that aren't just reactive but contextual. Imagine a student in an immersive VR space, moving through course content visually, spatially, and interactively—asking questions, testing ideas, and receiving tailored responses from a privacy-respecting, local AI tutor. It's an ambitious vision, but one that feels like the natural evolution of TEL and reflects PSF K1 by giving students more choice in how they interact with their learning.

I'm also concerned about the lack of open standards. Knox (2020) highlights how AI integration into education systems can reflect national and corporate priorities, potentially compromising educational autonomy. While tools like Copilot are powerful, their opacity and corporate ties limit their educational potential. We need transparent, accountable AI systems if we want to support academic freedom and innovation. I believe in technology as a democratising force, but only if it remains open, ethical, and student-focused.

## Professional Development Planning

My next formal step is applying for CMALT, which I see as a way to consolidate and articulate the TEL journey I'm already on. I'm fortunate to work alongside several Certified Members of ALT, and I look forward to joining that professional community. As with PSF V3, I am committed to evidencing my learning approaches and developing my practice. I believe CMALT recognition is one way of doing this.

Longer term, I'd like to explore collaborative research around generative AI in education, including projects like the Digital Backpack, our digital capability assessment and credentialing tool. I also want to improve my programming fluency so I can prototype some of the learning tools I imagine. Right now, generative AI itself is helping me do that, guiding me through Python and JavaScript as I experiment.

Eventually, I'd like to contribute more actively to the field through publications and collaborative tool-building. I'm even considering a PhD, though I'm more focused in the short term on meaningful, hands-on development that empowers students and reimagines what assessment and learning could be.

Before beginning this PGCert, I didn't value reflection as much as I do now. Having a scaffolded portfolio has helped me see its importance—not just for academic growth, but for refining my own thinking. I plan to continue this habit well beyond the PGCert, using tools like Jekyll and Markdown to build a sustainable, portable professional portfolio.

This process has reinforced many of my core beliefs: that digital tools can democratise learning, that students need agency, and that institutions must do better in protecting and empowering learners. It's also deepened my interest in systemic innovation, from immersive learning to ethical AI, from accessibility to data minimalism.

I've come away from this with a stronger sense of direction and a renewed belief that, while technology often introduces new challenges, it also opens doors for creativity, access, and transformation—especially when guided by thoughtful educators.
