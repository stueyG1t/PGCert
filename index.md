<p>When a student describes your session as *life changing*, it is a special moment. That is one of the most rewarding aspects of my work. I frequently support students who feel left behind in the rapidly changing digital environment, helping them gain confidence and competence. My name is Stuart Smith, and I am the Digital Skills Developer at the University of Greenwich, a unique role focused on student engagement with and appropriate use of digital technologies. This reflects UKPSF dimensions K4 (the use and value of appropriate learning technologies) and V2 (promoting participation in higher education and equality of opportunity for learners).</p>

<p>My role builds on earlier work in learning technology across both commercial and university settings. It is a challenging but enjoyable position because it spans multiple faculties and disciplines, requiring flexibility and a cross-institutional approach. Greenwich has ambitions to become “digital-first” (University of Greenwich, 2021, p. 45) in terms of working environment and service delivery, and my work directly contributes to this strategy.</p>

<p>I design and plan learning activities and support student learning in digital contexts, aligning with UKPSF A1 (design and planning of learning activities), A2 (teaching and supporting learning), and A4 (developing effective learning environments supported by appropriate technologies). Technology isn’t something I add into my work—it’s woven into it.</p>

<p>My pedagogical stance is rooted in constructivist and humanist traditions (Vygotsky, 1978; Freire, 1970; Rogers, 1969), which emphasise learner agency, reflection, and the social context of knowledge building. Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI), such as Copilot, represents a powerful but sometimes unreliable tool. In my teaching, I aim to co-opt such technologies to support and not supplant learner centred education.</p>

<p>For example, a recent session I ran on digital wellbeing was heavily disrupted by a compulsory, unscheduled hardware update. Rather than conceal my frustration or embarrassment, I shared the experience openly with the students. This prompted sympathetic responses and, more importantly, conversations about shared coping strategies. It became a live opportunity to reinforce the idea that in a technology-led world, human connection, adaptability, and reflection remain critical. In this way, I model humanist and constructivist values while equipping students to navigate imperfect digital systems.</p>

<p>As part of the PGCert module, we were encouraged to use Microsoft <a href="#glossary-sway" id="back-to-sway">Sway</a> to present our portfolios. While Sway is a valuable tool within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, I chose to build my portfolio using <a href="#glossary-jekyll" id="back-to-jekyll">Jekyll</a> and <a href="#glossary-markdown" id="back-to-markdown">Markdown</a>. This is a technically more challenging solution, but it offers advantages such as speed, flexibility, and stronger compliance with accessibility standards. Combining Markdown with HTML, CSS, and other web technologies creates a fast-loading, low-resource, and highly customisable platform for sharing information.</p>

<p>This more technical and independent approach aligns with my belief that educators should understand the underlying technologies they use. <a href="#glossary-wysiwyg" id="back-to-wysiwyg">WYSIWYG</a> (What You See Is What You Get) tools like Sway or <a href="#glossary-squarespace" id="back-to-squarespace">Squarespace</a> provide ease of use, but can mask important issues around accessibility and interoperability.</p>

<p>In the early science fiction novel *The Machine Stops*, E. M. Forster warned of a society that placed blind trust in a system no one truly understood: “You talk as if a god had made the Machine… I believe that you pray to it when you are unhappy. Men made it, do not forget that” (Forster, 1928). We must be careful not to confuse convenience with resilience. By engaging directly with web code, I am better positioned to problem-solve, advocate for inclusive design, and promote technical curiosity—essential traits for a digitally fluent educator.</p>

<p>A core part of my practice involves teaching students how to utilise tools like Copilot and other digital technologies to support their everyday learning. Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) is rapidly becoming a widely adopted tool in everyday life. It is in line with PSF K2 to help students learn how to use this tool appropriately to support their studies and as a subject in its own right. This reflects my own practice. For example, when I was running an Excel tutorial and discovered that key learning materials had been deprecated, I used Copilot in real time to generate a new learning activity based on prompts that students helped craft. This turned what could’ve been a failure into a moment of digital empowerment. Students saw that a lack of knowledge wasn’t a dead end—it was an opportunity for collaboration, experimentation, and co-creation.</p>

<p>Copilot excels in many areas, particularly as a personal tutor or coach. Its ability to understand natural language, propose ideas, and reframe problems makes it very useful for students with lower confidence or those from non-traditional learning backgrounds. This reflects PSF V2, helping ensure equity of access to opportunity. But it’s not without constraints. Enterprise-level censorship, hallucinations, and limited philosophical depth can frustrate more advanced users. In particular, Microsoft has implemented filters in Copilot that block certain terms—such as those associated with violence, politics, or elections—which can hinder academic inquiry in higher education (Field, 2024). In terms of ethical use, Copilot’s cheery tone sometimes masks a lack of clarity about its boundaries, and it can become evasive when questioned about deeper topics.</p>

<p>Additionally, I am implementing SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) and LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) integrations to ensure improved access to LinkedIn Learning across Moodle. This technical foundation is helping embed digital learning more meaningfully within the student experience. While a technical activity, the integration into Moodle is supportive of PSF A2: students and tutors already use Moodle, so it is appropriate to use this familiar environment as a bridge to new learning. Students and tutors will have fewer steps to access the learning materials of LinkedIn Learning by having it embedded in Moodle. As Moodle is the preferred learning environment at the institution, it makes sense to remove barriers to resource uptake by simplifying access. SCIM will mean that students have smoother access to LinkedIn Learning materials and, additionally, tutors will be able to track learning in the Moodle system alongside their own teaching materials.</p>

<p>In the development of the Digital Backpack, I have been working cross-institutionally to address a critical gap in student skills assessment (Jisc, 2019). The project reflects my ability to manage complex TEL initiatives aligned with both pedagogical goals and institutional strategy. Through iterative consultation, I ensured the design was both pedagogically robust and operationally feasible. The assessment is an important starting point in making sure that learners receive the right support and guidance (PSF A4) to develop their digital skills. Confidence building is a key part of my work in teaching digital skills. The Digital Backpack is an extension of the confidence measures that I use in my workshops. One of my teaching observers remarked, “Starting the session with an individual confidence-level test is a great way to encourage people to think about their prior knowledge.” The Digital Backpack will encourage further, more detailed reflection to help students recognize the areas they need to address.</p>

<p>I have learned that it is very difficult to combat subjectivity in the development of assessment tools such as these. We all have biases, but I feel that by engaging with students and colleagues in the development process, I have the best chance of reducing their impact. The Digital Backpack is in its first iteration, and I am keen to emphasise that there is much to be learned; gathering and acting on the lessons will ensure that the tool becomes more finished and more useful.</p>

<p>Increasingly, I champion Markdown as a core TEL production tool. Markdown is one of the oldest and most robust text formats available and has particular value in education because of its accessibility, structure, and long-term archival viability. As Oelen and Auer (2019) note, <q>“it is possible to create presentation slides without the need for visual interaction, making it suitable for non-sighted users,”</q> highlighting Markdown’s compatibility with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation. Unfortunately, Microsoft’s broader ecosystem isn’t Markdown-friendly. Word and Teams, for instance, don’t offer clean Markdown workflows, which can present real limitations when working with screen readers or preparing structured content for future reuse.</p>

## Reflective Area 2 – Learning, Teaching and Assessment

<p>A core part of my practice involves teaching students how to use tools like Copilot and other digital technologies to support their learning. Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) is rapidly becoming integrated into everyday academic and professional life. In line with UKPSF K2, it is essential to help students use these tools appropriately, not only as aids to study, but as subjects of critical inquiry.</p>

<p>This is reflected in my own practice. For example, during an Excel tutorial, I discovered that key externally supplied learning materials had been deprecated. Instead of abandoning the activity, I used Copilot in real time to generate a new learning task based on prompts co-created with the students. What could have been a failure became a moment of digital empowerment. Students saw that a lack of knowledge wasn’t a dead end, it was an opportunity for collaboration, experimentation, and co-creation.</p>

<p>Copilot excels as a personal tutor or coach. Its ability to interpret natural language, propose ideas, and reframe problems makes it especially valuable for students with lower confidence or those from non-traditional educational backgrounds. This supports UKPSF V2 by promoting equity of access to learning opportunities. However, Copilot also presents limitations. Enterprise-level censorship, hallucinations, and shallow philosophical depth can frustrate more advanced users. For instance, Microsoft has implemented filters that block terms related to politics, violence, or elections, posing challenges for critical engagement in higher education (Field, 2024). Ethically, Copilot’s cheerful tone can obscure its boundaries and limitations, becoming evasive when probed more deeply.</p>

<p>Beyond teaching, I have been involved in operational work to support wider digital access and learning. For example, I am leading the implementation of SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) and LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) to improve access to LinkedIn Learning through Moodle. While this is a technical undertaking, it directly supports UKPSF A2, A4, and K4. Moodle is already widely used by students and staff, so embedding LinkedIn Learning within it reduces access barriers and promotes uptake. SCIM will also allow for smoother logins and enable tutors to track student engagement with LinkedIn Learning alongside their own teaching materials.</p>

<p>Another key operational contribution is the development of the Digital Backpack a cross-institutional initiative that addresses a gap in digital skills assessment (Jisc, 2019). This project reflects my ability to manage complex TEL initiatives aligned with both pedagogical goals and institutional strategy. Through iterative consultation, I ensured the tool was both pedagogically robust and operationally feasible. The diagnostic is designed to provide students with timely, formative feedback, helping them identify areas for improvement. This aligns with UKPSF A4 and V3 by ensuring students are appropriately supported and encouraged to develop autonomy.</p>

<p>Confidence-building is central to my work. The Digital Backpack extends the confidence measures I use in my workshops. One of my observers noted, “Starting the session with an individual confidence-level test is a great way to encourage people to think about their prior knowledge.” The tool promotes further reflection and self-awareness, helping students take ownership of their development.</p>

<p>I have learned that it is difficult to completely eliminate subjectivity in assessment design. We all have biases, but by involving students and colleagues in the development process, I believe we can reduce their impact. The Digital Backpack is still evolving, and I am committed to gathering feedback and making continuous improvements to ensure it becomes more effective over time.</p>

<p>Finally, I continue to advocate for Markdown as a core TEL production tool. As one of the oldest and most robust text formats, Markdown offers structure, accessibility, and long-term viability. It is screen reader–friendly and supports keyboard navigation—benefits highlighted by Oelen and Auer (2019), who note that “it is possible to create presentation slides without the need for visual interaction, making it suitable for non-sighted users.” Unfortunately, Microsoft’s ecosystem is not optimised for Markdown. Tools like Word and Teams do not support clean Markdown workflows, limiting accessibility and reusability for content creators and users alike.</p>

## Reflective Area 3 – Wider Context

<p>Accessibility and data ethics are foundational to my professional identity. My MSc dissertation, *Can a Virtual Learning Environment Interface Meet the Needs of Dyslexics and Non-Dyslexics?* (Smith, 2001), explored inclusive interface design and advocated for flexible, learner-led approaches over rigid instructional models. Since then, I have contributed to sector-wide publications on accessibility (Smith, 2002) and remained actively engaged in CPD and peer collaboration to refine inclusive practices (UKPSF A5, V5).</p>

<p>My work consistently addresses systemic barriers to access, especially for students with learning differences or limited digital experience. Many Greenwich students experience digital inequality in terms of equipment, software access, or digital confidence. The <em>Digital Backpack</em>initiative offers a scaffolded and non-judgemental route to digital competence, embedding familiar platforms like Microsoft 365 and LinkedIn Learning. This helps address skill gaps without stigmatisation, ensuring inclusive engagement with institutional technologies (UKPSF V2, V5).</p>

<p>I also engage students in critical conversations about the <em>ethical use of AI in education</em> Scholars such as Selwyn (2019) and Luckin (2018) highlight the potential of AI for personalising learning but also warn about the risks of embedded bias, inequity, and opaque algorithmic systems. These concerns are especially pertinent as generative AI becomes more embedded in academic workflows. For instance, current institutional policy prohibits the use of AI-assisted translation for assessed work, while private tutoring—often expensive and unregulated—is permitted. I encourage students to critique these contradictions, fostering both digital literacy and ethical awareness (UKPSF K3, V5).</p>

<p>In my teaching, I present <em>information management as stewardship</em>: understanding what data is collected, who controls it, and how it may be used. This principle informs my advocacy for open standards and accessible content formats, which promote transparency, portability, and learner autonomy. It also underpins my technical choices such as my preference for Markdown over proprietary formats—as a way to maintain openness and resilience in digital content creation.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, I am increasingly concerned by the <em>centralisation of digital learning environments</em> under proprietary AI platforms. Unlike the early, decentralised internet, today’s generative AI tools—Microsoft's Copilot, OpenAI's ChatGPT, and Google Gemini are closed systems, reliant on vast, non-transparent infrastructures. This raises critical questions about academic freedom, institutional dependency, and the ethical governance of digital education.</p>

> “There will be one company that creates a personal agent... Everything will be mediated through your agent... Whoever wins that will take the current dispersed, high profit areas, and move them into a single area.”  
> — Bill Gates (2023)
>
<p>In this context, I believe educators must not only adopt digital tools but also interrogate their provenance, governance, and implications. This responsibility is central to my professional practice as a digitally literate and ethically grounded educator.</p>

## Reflective Area 4 – Specialist Interest
<details open>
  <summary>Expand or collapse this section</summary>

<p>My core area of specialist interest is the intersection of <em>generative AI</em>, <em>immersive environments</em>, and <em>personalised learning</em>. I am particularly drawn to open-source AI models that can run locally and be integrated with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks. These tools enable students to interrogate large sets of course data, reading lists, and materials using natural language—in their own voice and at their own pace. This reflects UKPSF A5, as I continue to enhance my professional practice by developing these emerging capabilities and exploring the boundaries of what educational technologies can offer.</p>

<p>I see enormous potential for building <em>learning companions</em> that are not just reactive but <em>contextual</em>. Imagine a student navigating an immersive Virtual Reality <a href="#glossary-vr" id="back-to-vr">(VR)</a> environment—engaging with course content visually, spatially, and interactively—while asking questions, testing ideas, and receiving tailored feedback from a localised, privacy-respecting AI tutor. While ambitious, this scenario aligns with the natural evolution of Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) and exemplifies UKPSF K1, by expanding the modes through which students can engage with their subject matter.</p>

<p>Additionally, I am beginning to explore how <em><a href="#glossary-microsoft-mesh" id="back-to-mesh">Microsoft Mesh</a></em> technology could be used to deliver context-appropriate immersive learning environments through Microsoft Teams. A key challenge lies in the use of Virtual Reality (VR) headsets and the various IT policies that come into play if such devices are institutionally supplied. While headsets are not strictly necessary as Mesh environments can also be accessed via standard 2D desktop screens, this may be perceived as a lesser experience by learners.</p>

<p>At present, widespread adoption of VR seems unlikely. Headsets remain expensive, bulky, and technically specialised. Even now, the university continues to provide on-site computer access for some students, reflecting a recognition of persistent digital inequality. It is difficult to imagine a near term scenario where VR headsets become ubiquitous enough for access to be assumed. However, <em>Augmented Reality <a href="#glossary-ar" id="back-to-ar">(AR)</a></em> technologies are evolving more rapidly, with increasingly portable and cost-effective devices entering the market. As VR and AR continue to converge, the lower cost and improved portability of AR glasses may provide a more viable pathway for immersive learning. These developments offer a glimpse into how platforms like Microsoft Mesh could eventually be adopted more broadly in education particularly if delivered through devices that are more accessible, flexible, and well-suited to blended learning contexts. This aligns with UKPSF A4 (developing inclusive learning environments), K4 (evaluating learning technologies), and V2 (promoting equality of opportunity), while also reflecting a research informed mindset (V3).</p>

<p>At the same time, I remain concerned about the <em>lack of open standards</em> and the implications this has for academic freedom. Knox (2020) warns that AI’s integration into education can reflect national or corporate priorities, potentially undermining the autonomy of institutions and educators. While tools like Copilot offer significant functionality, their proprietary nature and opaque design limit their educational potential—particularly when we cannot interrogate or customise their outputs. This raises important ethical and practical considerations aligned with UKPSF V4 and K5.</p>

<p>In my own work, I advocate for <em>transparent, student-focused AI systems</em> that are built on ethical, open-source foundations. For example, I have begun experimenting with lightweight, local AI agents that can be deployed in closed environments for data-sensitive projects. I see these efforts as small but important steps toward reimagining AI not as a black box, but as a co-created, accountable partner in learning.</p>

<p>I believe in technology as a <em>democratising force</em>—but only if it remains open, ethical, and aligned with student empowerment, not corporate convenience. This vision underpins both my technical practice and my pedagogical stance.</p>

<p>My next formal step is applying for <em>CMALT</em> (Certified Membership of the Association for Learning Technology), which I see as an opportunity to consolidate and articulate the Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) journey I am already on. I am fortunate to work alongside several Certified Members of ALT and look forward to joining that professional community. In line with UKPSF V3 and A5, I am committed to evidencing my learning approaches and continuously developing my professional practice. I believe CMALT recognition is a valuable step toward that goal.</p>

<p>In the longer term, I aim to explore collaborative research into the role of <em>generative AI in education</em>, building on initiatives such as the <em>Digital Backpack</em>—our institution’s digital capability assessment and credentialing tool. I also plan to improve my <em>programming fluency</em>, enabling me to prototype some of the tools and learning environments I currently envision. Currently, Generative AI itself is supporting that development, guiding me through Python and JavaScript as I experiment with new ideas.</p>

<p>Eventually, I hope to contribute more actively to the field through <em>publications</em>, <em>collaborative tool-building</em>, and knowledge exchange. I am also considering pursuing a <em>PhD</em>, though for now my focus remains on <em>meaningful, practice-led development</em> that empowers students and reimagines how assessment and learning can be approached in a rapidly changing educational landscape.</p>

<p>Before beginning this PGCert, I did not place great value on reflective practice. Now, having worked through a scaffolded portfolio process, I recognise reflection as essential—not only for academic development but also for refining my professional judgement and decision-making. I intend to continue this habit beyond the PGCert, using tools like Jekyll and Markdown to maintain a sustainable, portable professional portfolio.</p>

<p>This process has reinforced many of my core beliefs: that digital tools, when used thoughtfully, can democratise learning; that students thrive when given meaningful agency; and that educators and institutions have a responsibility to foster both empowerment and protection for learners. These principles reflect UKPSF V1 and V4.</p>

<p>It has also deepened my interest in systemic innovation—whether through immersive technologies, ethical AI, accessibility, or data minimalism—and has encouraged me to seek out evidence-informed approaches (UKPSF V3) in both strategy and pedagogy.</p>

<p>I conclude this phase of my professional development with a clearer sense of direction and a renewed belief that while technology often introduces new challenges, it also unlocks opportunities for creativity, inclusion, and transformation—particularly when guided by reflective and ethically grounded educators.</p>
