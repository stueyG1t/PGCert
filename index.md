My name is Stuart Smith, and I work as the Digital Skills Developer at the University of Greenwich, a unique role focusing on student engagement with digital technologies. This role builds on earlier work I’ve done in learning technology in both commercial and university settings.

Technology isn’t something I add into my work—it’s woven into it. My pedagogical stance is rooted in constructivist and humanist traditions (Vygotsky, 1978; Freire, 1970; Rogers, 1969), which emphasise learner agency, reflection, and the social context of knowledge building.

With the rise of generative AI, tools like Copilot have become central to my work. They are transformative in how we think, create, and support learners.

As part of the PGCert module, we were encouraged to use Microsoft Sway to present our portfolios. While Sway is a powerful tool integrated within Microsoft 365—an advantage for institutions already using that ecosystem—if the portfolio author leaves the Sway-hosting institution, the portfolio is lost unless exported as a static PDF or Word file. This is very limiting for a portfolio. In contrast, I chose to build my portfolio using Jekyll and Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight, structured format that promotes portability, accessibility, and web-standards compliance. Combining Markdown with HTML, CSS, and other web technologies creates a powerful, fast-loading, low-resource tool for sharing information.

A more technical and independent approach to portfolio creation aligns with my belief that educators should understand the underlying technologies they use. WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) tools like Sway or Squarespace offer ease but can mask key accessibility and interoperability considerations.

In the early sci-fi novel _The Machine Stops_, E.M. Forster warned of a society that placed blind trust in a system no one truly understood. <q>“You talk as if a god had made the Machine… I believe that you pray to it when you are unhappy. Men made it, do not forget that.”</q> (Forster, 1928). We must be careful not to confuse convenience with resilience. By engaging directly with web code, I’m better positioned to problem-solve, advocate for inclusive design, and promote technical curiosity. These are essential traits in a digitally fluent educator.

## Reflective Area 1 Operational Issues

A core part of my practice involves teaching students how to utilise tools like Copilot and other digital technologies to support their everyday learning. Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) is rapidly becoming a widely adopted tool in everyday life. It is in line with PSF K2 to help students learn how to use this tool appropriately to support their studies and as a subject in its own right. This reflects my own practice. For example, when I was running an Excel tutorial and discovered that key learning materials had been deprecated, I used Copilot in real time to generate a new learning activity based on prompts that students helped craft. This turned what could’ve been a failure into a moment of digital empowerment. Students saw that a lack of knowledge wasn’t a dead end—it was an opportunity for collaboration, experimentation, and co-creation.

Copilot excels in many areas, particularly as a personal tutor or coach. Its ability to understand natural language, propose ideas, and reframe problems makes it very useful for students with lower confidence or those from non-traditional learning backgrounds. This reflects PSF V2, helping ensure equity of access to opportunity. But it’s not without constraints. Enterprise-level censorship, hallucinations, and limited philosophical depth can frustrate more advanced users. In particular, Microsoft has implemented filters in Copilot that block certain terms—such as those associated with violence, politics, or elections—which can hinder academic inquiry in higher education (Field, 2024). In terms of ethical use, Copilot’s cheery tone sometimes masks a lack of clarity about its boundaries, and it can become evasive when questioned about deeper topics.

Additionally, I am implementing SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) and LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) integrations to ensure improved access to LinkedIn Learning across Moodle. This technical foundation is helping embed digital learning more meaningfully within the student experience. While a technical activity, the integration into Moodle is supportive of PSF A2: students and tutors already use Moodle, so it is appropriate to use this familiar environment as a bridge to new learning. Students and tutors will have fewer steps to access the learning materials of LinkedIn Learning by having it embedded in Moodle. As Moodle is the preferred learning environment at the institution, it makes sense to remove barriers to resource uptake by simplifying access. SCIM will mean that students have smoother access to LinkedIn Learning materials and, additionally, tutors will be able to track learning in the Moodle system alongside their own teaching materials.

In the development of the Digital Backpack, I have been working cross-institutionally to address a critical gap in student skills assessment (Jisc, 2019). The project reflects my ability to manage complex TEL initiatives aligned with both pedagogical goals and institutional strategy. Through iterative consultation, I ensured the design was both pedagogically robust and operationally feasible. The assessment is an important starting point in making sure that learners receive the right support and guidance (PSF A4) to develop their digital skills. Confidence building is a key part of my work in teaching digital skills. The Digital Backpack is an extension of the confidence measures that I use in my workshops. One of my teaching observers remarked, “Starting the session with an individual confidence-level test is a great way to encourage people to think about their prior knowledge.” The Digital Backpack will encourage further, more detailed reflection to help students recognize the areas they need to address.

I have learned that it is very difficult to combat subjectivity in the development of assessment tools such as these. We all have biases, but I feel that by engaging with students and colleagues in the development process, I have the best chance of reducing their impact. The Digital Backpack is in its first iteration, and I am keen to emphasise that there is much to be learned; gathering and acting on the lessons will ensure that the tool becomes more finished and more useful.

Increasingly, I champion Markdown as a core TEL production tool. Markdown is one of the oldest and most robust text formats available and has particular value in education because of its accessibility, structure, and long-term archival viability. As Oelen and Auer (2019) note, <q>“it is possible to create presentation slides without the need for visual interaction, making it suitable for non-sighted users,”</q> highlighting Markdown’s compatibility with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation. Unfortunately, Microsoft’s broader ecosystem isn’t Markdown-friendly. Word and Teams, for instance, don’t offer clean Markdown workflows, which can present real limitations when working with screen readers or preparing structured content for future reuse.

## Reflective Area 2 – Learning, Teaching and Assessment

All of my teaching currently takes place online, primarily through Microsoft Teams. I’ve adapted my sessions to be fully interactive, even when students don’t turn on their cameras. This approach reflects PSF A1 and A2; it’s important to acknowledge how students prefer to engage online and to design and plan learning accordingly. Teaching needs to adapt to the social reality that the online space is different from the physical.

Tools like Mentimeter and Microsoft Forms allow me to create moments of live feedback and insight. These tools directly support a constructivist approach by enabling students to co-construct understanding through peer insight, shared questions, and formative, interactive contributions in real time. They help students who might otherwise be silent in a traditional classroom feel seen and heard. Mentimeter’s anonymity, in particular, is powerful; it gives students permission to admit they don’t know something or to experiment with an idea they aren’t confident about yet. Tools allowing anonymity are incredibly helpful when meeting PSF A3 by enabling direct feedback without identifying the student.

Copilot has become foundational to my teaching strategy. In an Excel session, for example, students used Copilot to create custom tutorials based on their own goals and questions. This increased relevance and showed them how to take ownership of their learning journey—supporting PSF K2. Separately, when demonstrating Microsoft Word’s Editor feature—which focuses on spelling, grammar, and style—many students were surprised to learn they already had access to such targeted support. These features are particularly empowering for those with lower academic English levels or dyslexia, providing real-time feedback that enhances writing quality without requiring generative input. This aligns with recent research showing AI-enhanced tools can significantly improve the learning experience for students with dyslexia by reducing cognitive load and supporting comprehension (Zhao et al., 2025).

Since Gen AI can be controlled directly by the learner, we uphold PSF V1—respect for individual learners—as students choose how to leverage AI to support their learning.

I’ve also noticed that TEL can be a double-edged sword: the lack of student cameras can make teaching online feel isolating, and bandwidth limitations or noisy environments mean some students attend from less-than-ideal locations. However, by incorporating chat-based interaction, flexible feedback loops, and instructional design that anticipates these limitations, we still create valuable learning experiences. I am committed to promoting engagement with learning (PSF V2), and to maintaining my own engagement, I continually develop new approaches and uses of technology to connect with students.

Inclusion remains a priority. Many students are multilingual or have experienced educational trauma. In one instance, a mature student previously bullied over digital skills realised she could use Copilot to reframe complex information in her own words—and was moved to tears. That moment underscored the emotional and psychological impact TEL can have in restoring agency.

## Reflective Area 3 – Wider Context

Accessibility and data ethics are foundational to my work. My MSc dissertation, _Can a Virtual Learning Environment Interface Meet the Needs of Dyslexics and Non-Dyslexics?_ (Smith, 2001), focused on interface design for learners with specific needs, advocating flexible over prescriptive lesson models. Since then, I’ve contributed to Jisc publications on accessibility (Smith, 2002), and I continue CPD and peer collaboration to refine my practice (PSF A5, V5).

Ethical questions around AI are central: scholars like Selwyn (2019) and Luckin (2018) note opportunities for personalised learning but warn about equity, bias, and the values we encode. For example, current policy prohibits AI-assisted translation of essays, yet private tutoring—often more expensive—is allowed. I facilitate critical debate on such inconsistencies, fostering digital literacy (PSF K3).

I teach that information management is stewardship—knowing what data exists, why, and who can access it. This principle underpins my advocacy for open standards and accessible formats, reflecting transparency and learner autonomy.

Many Greenwich students face digital inequality. The Digital Backpack project offers a scaffolded, non-judgmental path to digital competence, integrating familiar platforms like Microsoft 365 and LinkedIn Learning to bridge gaps in resources and skills.

The AI era promises unprecedented personalisation, automation, and insight. Yet unlike the web’s open-source, decentralised rise, generative AI relies on vast, proprietary infrastructure. Dominant players (Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini) remain closed-source. Bill Gates warned that a leading AI agent could centralise digital experiences, raising questions about institutional dependence and academic freedom (Gates, 2023).

> “There will be one company that creates a personal agent... Everything will be mediated through your agent... Whoever wins that will take the current dispersed, high profit areas, and move them into a single area.”
> — Bill Gates (2023)

## Reflective Area 4 – Specialist Interest (PSF A5, K1, K4, K5, V3)

My core area of specialist interest is the intersection of generative AI, immersive environments, and personalised learning. I'm especially drawn to open-source AI models that can run locally and be combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks. With these tools, we can let students interrogate large sets of course data, reading lists, and materials using natural language—in their own voice and at their own pace. I  believe it is in the spirit of PSF A5 to enhance my practice by developing these skills and pushing the boundaries of the technology in learning. 

I see huge potential for building learning companions that aren't just reactive but contextual. Imagine a student in an immersive VR space, moving through course content visually, spatially, and interactively—asking questions, testing ideas, and receiving tailored responses from a localised, privacy-respecting AI tutor. It's an ambitious vision, but one that feels like the natural evolution of TEL and reflects PSF K1 by giving students more choice in how they can interact with their learning.

I'm also concerned about the lack of open standards. Knox (Knox, 2020) highlights how AI integration into education systems can reflect national and corporate priorities, potentially compromising educational autonomy. While tools like Copilot are powerful, their opacity and corporate ties limit their educational potential. We need transparent, accountable AI systems if we want to support academic freedom and innovation. I believe in technology as a democratising force but only if it remains open, ethical, and student-focused.

## Professional Development Planning

My next formal step is applying for CMALT, which I see as a way to consolidate and articulate the TEL journey I'm already on. I'm fortunate to work alongside several Certified Members of ALT, and I look forward to joining that professional community. As with PSF V3 I am committed to evidence my learning approaches and develop my practice. I beleive CMALT recognition is one way of doing this.

Longer term, I'd like to explore collaborative research around generative AI in education, including projects like the Digital Backpack by our digital capability assessment and credentialing tool. I also want to improve my programming fluency so I can prototype some of the learning tools I imagine. Right now, Generative AI itself is helping me do that, guiding me through Python and JavaScript as I experiment.

Eventually, I'd like to contribute more actively to the field through publications and collaborative tool-building. I'm even considering a PhD, though I'm more focused in the short term on meaningful, hands-on development that empowers students and reimagines what assessment and learning could be.

Before beginning this PGCert, I didn't value reflection as much as I do now. Having a scaffolded portfolio has helped me see its importance—not just for academic growth, but for refining my own thinking. I plan to continue this habit well beyond the PGCert, using tools like Jekyll and Markdown to build a sustainable, portable professional portfolio.

This process has reinforced many of my core beliefs: that digital tools can democratise learning, that students need agency, and that institutions must do better in protecting and empowering learners. It's also deepened my interest in systemic innovation, from immersive learning to ethical AI, from accessibility to data minimalism.

I've come away from this with a stronger sense of direction and a renewed belief that, while technology often introduces new challenges, it also opens doors for creativity, access, and transformation—especially when guided by thoughtful educators.
